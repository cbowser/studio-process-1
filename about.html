    <p class="ph5 white roboto f5-ns f6 lh-copy"> is a designer, an artist, a programmer, an educator and software developer. He utilizes the seemingly techinical and calculated media of code, processing and software to create magnificent, aesthetically pleasing and unique pieces. Reas’ ideas and developments have inspired many artists to merge the barrier between art and electronics. In 2001 Reas and his colleague, Ben Fry, created Processing, a programming language intended for creating visual design and projects. Processing is used among many designers, artists, and architects today. Since it was developed, artists have used Processing in a variety of ways including projected stage designs for performances, interactive museum installations, posters and other printed work, images for film, and much more. For more information and to start using this language, vist the <a class="link" href="https://processing.org/">Processing website.</a> </p> </div>

    <p class="ph5 white roboto f5-ns f6 lh-copy"> Reas was introduced to the computer at an early age, using it mainly for video games and learn basic coding software. However, Reas' passion for drawing and creating caused him to distance himself from the computer during much of his adolescence.It wasn't until he started a design program at the University of Cincinnati that he started to use them again to draw and edit photos and videos. However, it was John Maeda's Aesthetics and Computation Group at MIT that enabled Reas to discover his passion for using code to design.</p></div>

<p class="ph5 white roboto f5-ns f6 lh-copy "> In 1998, Reas joined John Maeda and his Aesthetics and Computation Group at MIT. Maeda, an innovative designer and professor, had formed a group that focused on merging visual art with computation. Reas, intrigued by this concept, began studying with Maeda in 1998. It is during this time that Reas discovered his passion for creating art with this medium. He also met Fry while studying with this group and together, they began developing Processing.  Even today, Reas continues to contribute much of design generation and ideas to his time spent with this group.

<h2 class="roboto white ph4 pv1 bb f1 ttu tracked">Emergence </h2>
    <p class="ph5 white roboto f5-ns f6 lh-copy pb3"> Reas’ work is inspired by his fascination with the concept of emergence —creating structures without prior intentional development. In other words, he codes without knowing exactly what the outcome will be, and very often the result is an interesting design, idea or inspiration for a design. As he continues to iterate by changing, adapting or incorporating more code, he generates more and more unique outcomes, none of which he could have anticipated. This inability to anticipate an exact outcome, is what continues to inspire and intrigue Reas, resulting in the creation of fascinating pieces. Reas also likes the concept of taking such a technical, calculating machine —the computer— and making it work in ways that are unexpected and exciting.  </p> </div>
